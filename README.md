# SystemSimulationProject
System Simulation Project MM/c MM/c/L with or without breakdowns
In this project, we are asked to and have developed 4 queuing system simulations which are M/M/c,
M/M/c/L, M/M/c with breakdowns, M/M/c/L with breakdowns systems.
The aim of this project was to understand different types of queuing systems, learn to
implement queuing simulations and observe how different parameters affect the system.
